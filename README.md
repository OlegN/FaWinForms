# FaWinForms

This test project was created to help use Icon fonts as an image source for WinForms apps. The main idea and basic code were found here https://github.com/denwilliams/FontAwesome-WindowsForms after I'd become tired of using http://fa2png.io/ (really great) to replace big set of "old style" icons in the app.

Besides FontAwesome http://fontawesome.io/ project contains next popular icon fonts:
* Typicons http://www.typicons.com/
* Ionicons http://ionicons.com/

FaWinForms project included simple implementation for Button, PictureBox, ToolStripButton and also added custom SelectButton (2 states) and TabButton (SelectButton but with specific border rendering)
